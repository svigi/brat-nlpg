This directory contains example datasets compatible with brat.

Unpack these in your DATA directory and set permissions appropriately
to visualize. Note that to edit datasets distributed as separate .a1
and .a2 files (or similar), you will first need to run tools/merge.py
to create a merged .ann file.
